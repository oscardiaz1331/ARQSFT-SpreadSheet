Use case Number: 7
Use case Name: ComputeFormula

Actors and their interests:
System

Preconditions:
- A spreadsheet is created.
- A cell is selected.
- The cell content is a formula.

Postconditions:
- Returns the computed value.

Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow):
1. The system tokenizes the formula.
2. The system checks the syntax of the formula
3. The system converts objects Token into operands and operators
4. The system checks circular dependency
5. The system generates the postfix expression
6. The system evaluates the postfix expression

Extension (Alternative Flow):
1.a The system detects that a token has not been written correctly.
	1. The system notifies an error with a token.
2.a The system detects a wrong syntax.
	1. The system notifies the wrong syntax.
4.a The system identifies a circular dependency.
	1. The system notifies a circular dependency.
6.a The system cannot evaluate the postfix expression.
