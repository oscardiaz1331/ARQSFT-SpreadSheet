Use case Number: 10
Use case Name: ComputeSumFunction

Actors and their interests:
System

Preconditions:
- A spreadsheet is created.
- A cell is selected.
- A cell contains a formula.
- The function has arguments.
- The system identifies a cell with a formula containing the SUM function.

Postconditions:
- The system gives the result.

Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow):
1. The system retrieves the values of the arguments.
2. The system calculates the sum of the retrieved values.
3. The system updates the value of the cell.

SPECIFICATIONS:
Number compute() throws InvalidArgumentException
- Belongs to SUM class as polymorphic GRASP, because it is not a controller or creator and do the same functionality to the other subclasses.
- The method uses the attributes of the class to compute the sum of all these numbers. The system returns the value and updates the cell value.
