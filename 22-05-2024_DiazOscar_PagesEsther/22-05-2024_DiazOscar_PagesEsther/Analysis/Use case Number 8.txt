Use case Number: 8
Use case Name: EvaluatePostfix

Actors and their interests:
Users

Preconditions:
- A spreadsheet is created.
- A cell is selected.
- A cell is modified
- The user gives a formula.
- The formula is tokenized
- The shunting-yard algorithm is applied.
- The result of the shunting-yard algorithm is selected by the program.

Postconditions:
- The system gives the result.

Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow):
1. The program encounters an operand in the postfix expression.
2. The program puts the operand of the postfix expression in a stack.
3. Do steps 1 and 2 until there are no more elements to process in the queue.
4. Pop the end result.

Extension (Alternative Flow):
1.a The program encounters an operator in the postfix expression.
	1. The first element that pops off the stack will be the second element on the operator.
	2. The second element that pops off the stack will be the first element on the operator.
	3. The result is pushed.
	4. Go back to step 1.
4.a The system detects that the expression cannot be evaluated.
	1. The system finalize with an error that the expression cannot be evaluated due to a math error (for example dividing by 0).
